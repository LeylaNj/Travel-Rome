            <h3>Rome, the “Eternal City”</h3>
            <p>
              Rome is called the Eternal City because ancient Romans believed
              that no matter what happened to the world, or how many empires
              rose or fell, that Rome would go on forever.

              of the city continues to this day and it's no surprise with all
              its beauty and intrigue that Rome remains one of the most beloved
              tourist destinations in the world.

                  In the heart of the capital, a few steps from Campo de' Fiori,
                  a historic restaurant with a menu based on great ingredients,

                <p>
                  Reservations are an absolute must, but it’s always well worth
                  the planning for some of the best classic Roman fare. Favorite
                  menu items include the burrata Pugliese conpomodorini (burrata
                  with black pepper and sundried cherry tomatoes), the cacio e
                  pepe, the bucatini alla amatriciana, and the traditional
                  meatballs serve with san marzano tomatoes.

                <h4>Pizzeria Remo a Testaccio</h4>
                <p>
                  One of the most authentic, non-touristy spots for fantastic
                  Roman-style pizza in Rome is Pizzeria Remo a Testaccio. You’ll
                  feel like you’re a part of the neighborhood at this
                  locally-loved pizzeria, and not only is the pizza here super
                  affordable but it’s some of the best you’ll enjoy in town.
                </p>
                <h5>Address:</h5>
                <p>Piazza di S Maria Liberatrice, 44, 00153 Roma</p>
                <h5>What I like about it</h5>
                <p>
                  Long-standing, popular stop for wood-fired pizza, fried
                  arancini & croquettes, with outside tables. The margherita
                  with buffala mozzarella is the way to go, but other fantastic
                  pizzas include the pizza bianca with prosciutto crudo or the
                  funghi (mushroom) on a red pie.

                <h4>Armando al Pantheon</h4>
                <p>
                  A literal stone’s throw from the Pantheon, Armando al Pantheon
                  is one of the most difficult reservations to secure in Rome
                  because they simply do things right. With perfect foods with
                  high-quality ingredients, and a killer view from one of the
                  best restaurants in Rome, this would be a fantastic choice for
                  one of your meals in Roma.

                <p>
                  A long-standing restaurant serving hearty, traditional Roman
                  fare in a wood-paneled dining room. The bruschetta with butter
                  and anchovies are delightful, and the amatriciana and
                  carbonara here are particularly delicious.
